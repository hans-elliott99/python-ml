# Makemore
Makemore is deep learning project ([on github](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore)) by awesome researcher and teacher [Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.ai/). 

Here I replicate some of his work by following along to [his video walkthroughs](https://www.youtube.com/c/AndrejKarpathy/videos) and implementing my own ideas. 

Makemore teaches deep learning from a 'first principles' approach through NLP and in pytorch.
